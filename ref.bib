	abstract = {Trends in space technology development and rapidly increasing traffic in outer space are likely to lead to the emergence of a market for services for the removal of large debris objects to disposal orbits. The commercial benefits of Active Debris Removal missions are possible when multiple objects are removed by a single spacecraft-collector that flies between targets in an optimal sequence, trying to achieve a rational ratio between mission duration and fuel costs. Given the size of the large debris population, selecting candidates for removal and optimizing such a mission is a non-trivial task. In this paper, a review of solutions, which are proposed in 65 publications between 2010 and 2023 for the problem of path planning between space debris objects in low orbits, is performed. These solutions could be categorized into three main types. The search for transfer chains in the first type of approaches is based solely on combinatorics, supplemented by various heuristics as required. In the second case, combinatorial-heuristic algorithms fully or partially utilize the secular effects of the Earth's polar compression. Solutions of the third type are based only on the use of precession of the Right Ascension of the Ascending Node of the orbit. For each analyzed work, the following information is given: objects of study, maneuvering scheme for a flight between two successive objects, method of choosing the transfer sequence, and main results. At the end of this paper, a subjective general evaluation of the analyzed works is proposed. In order to deepen the reader's understanding of the problem of large space debris removal, this review also provides background information from related fields. The reasons for the growth of observable fragments in near-Earth space and the need to remove large objects to disposal orbits are shown. The history of experiments aimed at the development of ADR technology is given. The article contains a large number of explanatory illustrations.}

	abstract = {The threat of debris collisions in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) has driven many researchers to develop Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions to manage large debris in LEO. A modern method of capturing debris with a non-rigid tether has been a recent research focus because of difficult post capture dynamics associated with controlling an uncooperative debris through a tether. To facilitate these control schemes, this paper proposes a new two-stage inertia estimator that estimates all principal and products of inertia for an uncooperative space debris using LiDAR and tether force measurements made on-board a CubeSat sized chaser satellite. The method proposed in this work estimates the debris center of mass with a novel pseudo measurement Kalman Filter so that the full inertia tensor can be subsequently estimated using an additional iterative parameter identification algorithm. In addition, the paper achieves online inertia estimation without assuming the tether connection point on the debris by approximating its location using tether tension measurements. The proposed control and estimation scheme is shown in this paper to estimate the full debris inertia tensor even with frequent tether slackness. Two simulation scenarios are presented in this paper, one where the connection point of the tether on the debris is approximated using noiseless measurements of tether tension, and a second where the location of the tether connection point is approximated using noisy measurements of tether tension. For the simulation conditions used in this research, it is shown that the proposed two-stage estimator (TSE) is successful for both cases that the debris is inertially asymmetrical and tri-inertial with non-zero products of inertia.}

In the field of space operations, this approach has been successfully used for mission planning and scheduling. This manuscript proposes a framework that leverages the strengths of Constraint Programming for the preliminary analysis of space missions, introducing some modifications to tailor it to the application at hand. Specifically, it uses constraint propagation and search techniques to thoroughly explore the configuration space of a mission in an efficient manner. Consequently, it is able to quantify the performance of precomputed mission choices with respect to the mission requirements, as well as generate new ones that optimise such performance. The proposed methodology has been particularised for two application cases involving active debris removal missions for large constellations in low Earth orbit, namely, a chaser case and a mothership case. The chaser case considers a servicing satellite that rendezvouses with the failed satellites of the constellation and directly transports them to a disposal orbit. The mothership case comprises a servicing satellite that installs deorbiting kits in each of the failed satellites, except for the one removed in the last place. This way, the servicing satellite will only transport this object, while the deorbiting kits will carry out the disposal of the rest of them. This methodology has been successfully used to evaluate a preliminary mission analysis of both application cases developed under ESA’s Sunrise project.}

The main focus is to design a fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme capable of guaranteeing stability of the closed-loop system with consideration of unknown actuator faults and external disturbances (AFED). Firstly, this is achieved by developing a novel robust FTC (RFTC) strategy based on finite-time input-to-state stability (FTISS) theory. Furthermore, by utilizing adaptive mechanism, an adaptive FTC (AFTC) scheme is designed to tackle the difficulty in control parameter selecting of RFTC. Both the RFTC and AFTC can ensure the convergence of tracking errors despite unexpected AFED, and the control strategies proposed in this paper share a considerable feature that they do not require a priori knowledge of AFED. Finally, numerous studies are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the overall control approach.}

	ABSTRACT = {In the realm of non-cooperative space security and on-orbit service, a significant challenge is accurately determining the pose of abandoned satellites using imaging sensors. Traditional methods for estimating the position of the target encounter problems with stray light interference in space, leading to inaccurate results. Conversely, deep learning techniques require a substantial amount of training data, which is especially difficult to obtain for on-orbit satellites. To address these issues, this paper introduces an innovative binocular pose estimation model based on a Self-supervised Transformer Network (STN) to achieve precise pose estimation for targets even under poor imaging conditions. The proposed method generated simulated training samples considering various imaging conditions. Then, by combining the concepts of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and SIFT features for each sample, the proposed method minimized the disruptive effects of stray light. Furthermore, the feedforward network in the Transformer employed in the proposed method was replaced with a global average pooling layer. This integration of CNN’s bias capabilities compensates for the limitations of the Transformer in scenarios with limited data. Comparative analysis against existing pose estimation methods highlights the superior robustness of the proposed method against variations caused by noisy sample sets. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated through simulated data, enhancing the current landscape of binocular pose estimation technology for non-cooperative targets in space.},

	abstract = {Estimating the pose of an uncooperative spacecraft is an important computer vision problem for enabling the deployment of automatic vision-based systems in orbit, with applications ranging from on-orbit servicing to space debris removal. Following the general trend in computer vision, more and more works have been focusing on leveraging Deep Learning (DL) methods to address this problem. However and despite promising research-stage results, major challenges preventing the use of such methods in real-life missions still stand in the way. In particular, the deployment of such computation-intensive algorithms is still under-investigated, while the performance drop when training on synthetic and testing on real images remains to mitigate. The primary goal of this survey is to describe the current DL-based methods for spacecraft pose estimation in a comprehensive manner. The secondary goal is to help define the limitations towards the effective deployment of DL-based spacecraft pose estimation solutions for reliable autonomous vision-based applications. To this end, the survey first summarises the existing algorithms according to two approaches: hybrid modular pipelines and direct end-to-end regression methods. A comparison of algorithms is presented not only in terms of pose accuracy but also with a focus on network architectures and models’ sizes keeping potential deployment in mind. Then, current monocular spacecraft pose estimation datasets used to train and test these methods are discussed. The data generation methods: simulators and testbeds, the domain gap and the performance drop between synthetically generated and lab/space collected images and the potential solutions are also discussed. Finally, the paper presents open research questions and future directions in the field, drawing parallels with other computer vision applications.}

	ABSTRACT = {Over the last decades, the idea of smart cities has evolved from a visionary concept of the future into a concrete reality. However, the vision of smart cities has not been fully realized within our society, partly due to the challenges encountered in contemporary data collection systems. Despite these obstacles, advancements in deep learning and computer vision have propelled the development of highly accurate detection algorithms capable of obtaining 3D data from image sources. Nevertheless, this approach has predominantly centered on data extraction from a vehicle’s perspective, bypassing the advantages of using infrastructure-mounted cameras for performing 3D pose estimation of vehicles in urban environments. This paper focuses on leveraging 3D pose estimation from this alternative perspective, benefiting from the enhanced field of view that infrastructure-based cameras provide, avoiding occlusions, and obtaining more information from the objects’ sizes, leading to better results and more accurate predictions compared to models trained on a vehicle’s viewpoint. Therefore, this research proposes a new path for exploration, supporting the integration of monocular infrastructure-based data collection systems into smart city development.},

	ABSTRACT = {Lidar sensors enable precise pose estimation of an uncooperative spacecraft in close range. In this context, the iterative closest point (ICP) is usually employed as a tracking method. However, when the size of the point clouds increases, the required computation time of the ICP can become a limiting factor. The normal distribution transform (NDT) is an alternative algorithm which can be more efficient than the ICP, but suffers from robustness issues. In addition, lidar sensors are also subject to motion blur effects when tracking a spacecraft tumbling with a high angular velocity, leading to a loss of precision in the relative pose estimation. This work introduces a smoothed formulation of the NDT to improve the algorithm’s robustness while maintaining its efficiency. Additionally, two strategies are investigated to mitigate the effects of motion blur. The first consists in un-distorting the point cloud, while the second is a continuous-time formulation of the NDT. Hardware-in-the-loop tests at the European Proximity Operations Simulator demonstrate the capability of the proposed methods to precisely track an uncooperative spacecraft under realistic conditions within tens of milliseconds, even when the spacecraft tumbles with a significant angular rate.},

	abstract  = {In the robot finishing process of the assembly interface of large aerospace cylindrical components (short for assembly interface), to realize the high-precision and high-efficiency pose perception of the large component, an intelligent pose measurement method for the large component is proposed based on binocular vision and priori data. In this method, the global coordinate system of the robot finishing system is initially established using laser tracking measurement method and customized reference plates, giving a unified coordinate transformation datum for the interoperation of the finishing system's subsystems. Then, utilizing deep learning and digital image processing technologies, an algorithm for recognizing and locating key features of the large component is developed, which can realize the identification of key feature types and accurate localization of feature centroids. Following that, the global coordinate of the key feature centroid is determined using the proposed binocular vision three-dimensional (3D) coordinate reconstruction method. Meanwhile, by introducing the priori processing data of the large component to match the 3D reconstruction coordinates of the key feature centroids, the spatial pose of the large component can be calculated with high precision. Finally, the proposed method is experimentally validated using a case study of a large aerospace cylindrical component. Experimental results prove that the proposed method can achieve high-precision pose measurement of the large component, which can provide pose data support for the adjustment or modification of the cutting path of the robot that is generated by the as-designed model of the large component, to ensure the correctness of the robotic machining of the assembly interface, and thus the proposed method can meet the robot finishing needs of the large component.},

	ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) object detection plays a crucial role in civil, commercial, and military domains. However, the high proportion of small objects in UAV images and the limited platform resources lead to the low accuracy of most of the existing detection models embedded in UAVs, and it is difficult to strike a good balance between detection performance and resource consumption. To alleviate the above problems, we optimize YOLOv8 and propose an object detection model based on UAV aerial photography scenarios, called UAV-YOLOv8. Firstly, Wise-IoU (WIoU) v3 is used as a bounding box regression loss, and a wise gradient allocation strategy makes the model focus more on common-quality samples, thus improving the localization ability of the model. Secondly, an attention mechanism called BiFormer is introduced to optimize the backbone network, which improves the model’s attention to critical information. Finally, we design a feature processing module named Focal FasterNet block (FFNB) and propose two new detection scales based on this module, which makes the shallow features and deep features fully integrated. The proposed multiscale feature fusion network substantially increased the detection performance of the model and reduces the missed detection rate of small objects. The experimental results show that our model has fewer parameters compared to the baseline model and has a mean detection accuracy higher than the baseline model by 7.7%. Compared with other mainstream models, the overall performance of our model is much better. The proposed method effectively improves the ability to detect small objects. There is room to optimize the detection effectiveness of our model for small and feature-less objects (such as bicycle-type vehicles), as we will address in subsequent research.},

	ABSTRACT = {Cattle rumination behavior is strongly correlated with its health. Current methods often rely on manual observation or wearable devices to monitor ruminating behavior. However, the manual monitoring of cattle rumination is labor-intensive, and wearable devices often harm animals. Therefore, this study proposes a non-contact method for monitoring cattle rumination behavior, utilizing an improved YOLOv8-pose keypoint detection algorithm combined with multi-condition threshold peak detection to automatically identify chewing counts. First, we tracked and recorded the cattle’s rumination behavior to build a dataset. Next, we used the improved model to capture keypoint information on the cattle. By constructing the rumination motion curve from the keypoint information and applying multi-condition threshold peak detection, we counted the chewing instances. Finally, we designed a comprehensive cattle rumination detection framework to track various rumination indicators, including chewing counts, rumination duration, and chewing frequency. In keypoint detection, our modified YOLOv8-pose achieved a 96% mAP, an improvement of 2.8%, with precision and recall increasing by 4.5% and 4.2%, enabling the more accurate capture of keypoint information. For rumination analysis, we tested ten video clips and compared the results with actual data. The experimental results showed an average chewing count error of 5.6% and a standard error of 2.23%, verifying the feasibility and effectiveness of using keypoint detection technology to analyze cattle rumination behavior. These physiological indicators of rumination behavior allow for the quicker detection of abnormalities in cattle’s rumination activities, helping managers make informed decisions. Ultimately, the proposed method not only accurately monitors cattle rumination behavior but also provides technical support for precision management in animal husbandry, promoting the development of modern livestock farming.},

	ABSTRACT = {On-orbit servicing using a space robot is gaining popularity among the space community for both economic and safety aspects. In particular, the estimation of the relative motion of a noncooperative target is a challenging problem. This study presents a relative motion estimation scheme based on stereovision for noncooperative targets considering multiple solutions of rotational parameters. Specifically, the mass distribution of the target is identified based on the least-square method and the principle of conservation of angular momentum. Then, the determination of a unique principal axis coordinate frame of the target is employed to resolve the multiple-solution problem. In addition, an EKF (extended Kalman filter)-based filter with global observability is designed to estimate the full motion states and inertia parameters of the target. The convergence performance of the proposed method is verified by numerical simulation. The results also demonstrate that the method is robust to occlusion.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the kinematic models of the Strapdown Inertial Navigation System (SINS) and its errors on the SE(3) group in the Earth-Centered Inertial frame (ECI) are established. On the one hand, with the ECI frame being regarded as the reference, based on the joint representation of attitude and velocity on the SE(3) group, the dynamic of the local geographic coordinate system (n-frame) and the body coordinate system (b-frame) evolve on the differentiable manifold, respectively, and the high-order expansion of the Baker-Campbell-Haussdorff equation compensates for the non-commutative motion errors stimulated by strong maneuverability. On the other hand, the kinematics of the left- and right-invariant errors of the n-frame and the b-frame on the SE(3) group are separately derived, where the errors of the b-frame completely depend on inertial sensor errors, while the errors of the n-frame rely on position errors and velocity errors. In this way, the errors brought by the inconsistency of the reference coordinate system are tackled, and a novel attitude error definition is introduced to separate and decouple the factors affecting the dynamic of the n-frame errors and the b-frame errors for better attitude estimation. Through a turntable experiment and a car-mounted field experiment, the effectiveness of the proposed kinematic models in estimating attitude has been verified, with a remarkable improvement in yaw angle accuracy in the case of large initial misalignment angles, and the models developed have better robustness compared to the traditional SE(3) group-based model.},
